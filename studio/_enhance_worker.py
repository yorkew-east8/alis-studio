"""Subprocess worker for the prompt enhancer.

Runs mlx-lm (Qwen3) in its OWN process so its MLX/GPU stream state stays fully isolated from the
image-generation process. Mixing mlx-lm and the image model's MLX in one process corrupts MLX's
per-thread GPU stream and raises "There is no Stream(gpu, 0) in current thread".

Protocol (one JSON object per line): reads {"prompt": "..."} from stdin, writes {"rewritten": "..."}
or {"error": "..."} to stdout. All library noise (download bars, load logs) is sent to stderr so it
can never corrupt the stdout protocol.
